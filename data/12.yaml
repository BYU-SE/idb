  quote: The real story of how the Cloudflare service went down for 27 minutes is much more complex than 'a regular expression went bad'.
  
  summary: Configuration deployment led to an increase in CPU usage and a global outage of multiple services (Deployment)
  
  architecture: Web application firewalls and tooling for quickly updating rules worldwide. [21]

  root cause: A regular expression in a web application firewall rule contained excessive backtracking. [21,83,84]

  failure: CPU exhaustion leading to a failure in proxy, CDN and firewall services globally. [21, 22]

  impact: Users were served a 502 error page when visiting any affected domain. [25]

  how it happened: Engineer deployed a new web application firewall rule (to protect against cross-site scripting attacks). That rule required excessive CPU time to process for each request and led to a failure of all services accessed through the firewall, including services needed to mitigate the issue. [33,41,42,64]
  
  mitigation: Responders disabled the web application firewall component, reverted the change and re-enabled the firewall. [43,44,45]
