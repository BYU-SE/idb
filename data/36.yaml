  quote: The specific signature of this weekendâ€™s utility power failure resulted in an unusually long voltage sag (rather than a complete outage).

    description: Virtual servers (EC2) and attached storage units (EBS)
    blocks: 1
    
  - name: root cause
    description: Power redundancy system failed to open breakers during a loss of power from utility (initially an unusually long voltage sag and then a complete outage).
    blocks: 3
    
  - name: failure
    description: Loss of power to a significant number of instances led to unavailable (virtual) servers and attached storage units.
    blocks: [1,3]
    
  - name: impact
    description: Customers and auto-scaling systems could not launch new virtual servers (until responders manually failed over to other availability zones).
    blocks: [6,9]
    
  - name: how it happened
    description: Sever weather caused a reduction of utility power at one datacenter (experienced initially as an unusually long voltage sag rather than a complete outage). A set of breakers that would have opened in a complete outage did not open soon enough and the stored power (in the DRUPS) drained into the power grid and the DRUPS system shutdown leaving many visual instances with no power.
    blocks: [3,4]
  
  - name: mitigation
    description: Once responders determined it was safe to do so, they re-engaged the power line-ups, and then some virtual servers and storage units needed to be manually restored.
    blocks: [3,7,8]
