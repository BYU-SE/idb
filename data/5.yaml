  quote: In November of 2018, engineers on our Mandrill team identified the potential to reach wraparound, as the XIDs were climbing to approximately half their total limit during peak load. Our team determined wraparound was not an immediate threat, but we added a ticket to the backlog to set up additional monitoring.
  
structured abstract:

  - name: architecture
    description: Job processing application using several PostgreSQL databases as a shared key-value store that is sharded by key.  
    blocks: 12
    
  - name: root cause
    description: The sharding algorithm caused one database to have higher than normal writes and the autovacuuming process failed or fell behind.
    blocks: [12,13]
    
  - name: failure
    description: The databases went into safety shutdown mode leading to failed database writes.
    blocks: 13
    
  - name: impact
    description: 20% of jobs were delayed.
    blocks: [3,24]
    
  - name: how it happened
    description: Due to higher than normal traffic to one database (ie, one shard) the autovacuuming process failed or fell behind, and so the database went into safety shutdown mode to prevent transaction id wraparound. Jobs failed and were queued on the application servers causing disk space to run low.
    blocks: [12,13,14,15]
  
  - name: mitigation
    description: Dumped and restored the database while the vacuum process was in progress, leaving out non-essential data tables to speed up process.
    blocks: 22
