structured abstract:

  - name: architecture
    description: A network backbone of 114 computer-operated switches (4ESS) located across the country, all linked with a cascading network.
    blocks: 8
    
  - name: root cause
    description: A defect in the recovery software of each switch, meant that in the event of concurrent messages from the same switch that was marked as offline the first message's parameters overwrite the second's.
    blocks: 15
    
  - name: failure
    description: Switches (and backup links) continually reset (taking themselves) off line.
    blocks: 10

    description: 50 million phone calls (~50% of calls placed) were blocked over the nine hours it took to stabilize the system.

  - name: how it happened
    description: One switch (located in New York) peformed a routine self-test that indicated it is was nearing its load limits. The switch performed a mainteance reset and took itself momentarily off line. When it came back on line it began distributing calls from its queue. A second switch received two messages from the first switch less than 10 mililiseconds apart. Due to a defect the (nearly) concurrent messages led to information from the first to be over written by the second. When the switch detected the overwrite it activated a backup link while resetting itself. The same problem occured on the backup and on all of the 114 switches.
