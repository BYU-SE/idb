  technologies: SQL Server
  
  quote: It took us 2 minutes to notice the issue, 5 minutes to locate the source of the issue and 10 minutes to get service restored.
  
  architecture: Applications that depend on an SQL Server primary that has multiple standby servers [2]

  root cause: A SQL Server bugcheck caused by a (suspected) bad memory chip; and a fail-over related code defect [2,3] 
  
  failure: The service went into read-only mode for approximately 5 minutes and offline for 12 minutes [12]

  impact: Service outage and 3.5 seconds of data loss [1]

  how it happened: A bugcheck in the primary SQL Server placed the primary in read only state, but application-level failovers were disabled due to a code defect, so the SQL server failed, and the network went offline [2]
  
  mitigation: A sanity check on the SQL health was completed and the sites were put back into read-write mode [2]
