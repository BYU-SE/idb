  technologies: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) , Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
  
  quote: I checked on things two hours later. The issue had not resolved itself. It became larger.
  
  summary: Exceeding disk space and available throughput limits led to a failed deployment and cluster instances in bad states (Exceeding limits)

  architecture: Multiple Kubernetes clusters for different use cases, each with Elastic Block Stores (EBS). [5]
  
  root cause: All activity on clusters exceeded available disk IO capacity (EBS IOPS). [38]

  failure: A complete shutdown of an internal cluster. [3]

  impact: Internal services provided by the cluster unavailable (Tiller, new pod creation, etc) [7,8,9,10,11]

  how it happened: While running tests on the internal Kubernetes clusters, a small number of containers were deployed, overloading the disk IO capacity. [13]
  
  mitigation: Terminated three nodes and waited for new instances to join the cluster. [22]
