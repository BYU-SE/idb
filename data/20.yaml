  quote: For the past couple of days, weâ€™ve been working around the clock to restore full access as soon as possible.

  architecture: Thousands of databases, each with a master machine and two replica machines. [4]

  root cause: An upgrade script had a defect in the way that it determined whether a database machine was active (and therefore not safe to upgrade). [6]

  failure: Multiple databases failed. [6]

  impact: An outage for the service depending on those databases. [6]

  how it happened: During a database upgrade, a defect in the upgrade script led it to believe several active databases were inactive and so it performed the upgrade. Database transactions/replication actions were interrupted and master-replica pairs failed. [5,6]

  mitigation: A recovery from backup for each affected database, which took from a few hours to 2 days depending on the database. [8]
