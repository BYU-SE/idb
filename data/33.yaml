  quote: Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended.
  
  architecture: Multiple regional datacenters with multiple subsystems each with multiple servers. [1]

  root cause: A command executed by an engineer with incorrect paramters. [1]

  failure: A large number of servers were removed from two sybsystems, beyond the number that could be tolerated. [1]

  impact: Complete outage of the (S3) service API in one region. [1]

  how it happened: In response to slowness in the billing system, an engineer executed a command to remove a small number of servers from a subsystem and entered the command incorrectly. A larger number of servers than intended were removed, leading to outages in two subsystems and many dependent services. [1]
  
  mitigation: A full resart of the two subsystems restored functionality within 5 hours. [1,2]
