  technologies: Google’s internal blob, Google Cloud Platform, Google Cloud Storage, Stackdriver Monitoring, App’s Engine Blobstore API, Google services (Gmail, Photos, Google Drive, etc.)
  
  quote: User-visible [services that use the failing service] also saw elevated error rates, although the user impact was greatly reduced by caching and redundancy built into those services. 
  
  summary: Configuration change caused an overload of traffic and a cascade of failures through mulitple services (Deployment)

  architecture: A data store system (storing "blob" data) with multiple dependent systems, most of which cache the data.
  
  root cause: A configuration change to the data store system that overloaded one of the subsystems.
  
  failure: Elevated error rates (20% on average, peaking at 31%) from data store system.
  
  impact: Services that depend on the storage system (eg, Gmail, Photos, Google Drive) experienced failures (mimized by data caching), increased (long tail) latency.
  
  how it happened: A data store system had an (unexplained in the report) increase in storage resources used, and so responders made a configuration change which had a side effect of overloading the subsystem used for looking up location of stored data. The increased load led to a cascading failure.
  
  mitigation: Engineers stopped the configuration change deployment and manually reduced traffic levels until tasks restarted (as they would otherwise crash on star up due to load).
