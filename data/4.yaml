  title: Incident report on memory leak caused by Cloudflare parser bug
  organization: Cloudflare
  product: Cloudflare
  start_ts: 2017/02/13
  end_ts: 2017/02/21
  author: John Graham-Cumming (Chief Technology Officer)
  url: https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/ 
  technologies: NGINX, Ragel
  
  quote: So, the bug had been dormant for years until the internal feng shui of the buffers passed between NGINX filter modules changed with the introduction of cf-html.
  
  summary: Deployment altered webserver's buffering strategy, exposed a preexisting defect, and led to a buffer overflow (Deployment)

  architecture: NGINX webserver, with multiple custom modules, including a Ragel based HTML parser used to modify HTML. [15,18]
  
  root cause: A latent defect in how a custom webserver module checked for the end of a buffer. [27,98]
  
  failure: Buffer overrun while preparing responses to some HTTP requests. [28]
  
  impact: Webserver returned corrupted webpages which contained private information (cookies, authentication tokens, etc). [3,9]
  
  how it happened: A new module was added to the webserver which subtly changed its buffering and triggered the latent defect (in a second module) leading to the buffer overrun and corrupted webpages. [20]
  
  mitigation: Deployed fix for end of buffer check. Requested external organizations to clear corrupted pages from caches. [39,94]
