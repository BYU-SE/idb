  quote: There was a single 'DROP TRIGGER' query that was attempting to take an exclusive lock on the whole table. It appears that PostgreSQL blocks new attempts to take a shared lock while an exclusive lock is wanted. 
  
  summary: Database deadlock due to autovacuum conflict with code

  architecture: An API layer that calls multiple sharded PostgreSQL databases. Each shard is a three-node PostgreSQL cluster using synchronous replication. [8,9,10]

  root cause: During a particular database maintenance operation (vacuuming to prevent transaction id wraparound) any transaction that requests an exclusive lock is blocked and subsequent requests for a shared lock are blocked. [13,30,31]

  failure: All transactions on one table on one shard were blocked. [13]

  impact: API clients experienced high-latency failures (500-level responses) for between 19% and 27% for requests. [4,12]

  how it happened: Vacuuming to prevent transaction id wraparound was automatically initiated by the PostgreSQL autovacuuming process. While that was running a ('drop trigger') transaction requested an exclusive lock, blocking until the autovacuuming process completed. Subsequent transactions (requesting a shared lock) blocked behind the 'drop trigger' request causing failures and high latency. [28,29,30]
  
  mitigation: Retune the threshold at which "vacuuming to prevent transaction id wraparound" occurs, temporarily opting to monitor transaction metrics and manually initiate the database maintenance process. [40]
