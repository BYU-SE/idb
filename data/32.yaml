  technologies: Redis
  
  quote: Slightly over 25% of our servers and several network devices rebooted as a result. This left our infrastructure in a partially operational state and generated alerts to multiple on-call engineers.
  
  summary: A power distruption caused servers from multiple services to reboot into an error state (due to residual static electricity in hard drives and application level dependencies)
  
  architecture: Datacenter with servers running applications with dependencies on Redis clusters.

  root cause: Power disruption to database; a known firmware issue prevented machines from recognizing their own drives after power-cycle; and some application processes (unnecessarily) depend on Redis for starting up.

  failure: Sever machines would not boot after power-cycle; Redis clusters were unavailable; and application processes failed to (re)start.

  impact: Applications began serving HTTP 503 repsonses to users.
  
  how it happened: The datacenter experienced a brief disruption in the systems that supply power to the servers and equipment. 25% of servers and several network devices rebooted, leaving the infrastructure in a partially operational state. Reboots of some machine types failed (due to physical drives not being recognized) and some application processes would not start because Redis clusters were unavailable.
  
  mitigation: Repaired servers that would not boot by removing residual static electricity (aka "flea power"); rebuilt Redis clusters on alternate hardware (ie, restoring data onto standby equipment).
