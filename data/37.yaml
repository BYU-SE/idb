  - name: architecture
    description: A fleet of application servers (running an authentication service) backed by a relational database.
    blocks: 10
    
  - name: root cause
    description: Traffic exceeded database capacity; and a queuing strategy for failed database requests.
    blocks: 10
    
  - name: failure
    description: Database requests failed and were were queued on the application servers.
    blocks: 10
    
  - name: impact
    description: Increased authentication latency and intermittent request timeouts for all customer applications.
    blocks: 5
    
  - name: how it happened
    description: A surge of inbound requests exceeded database capacity and were queued by the application. Even after the traffic subsided the queued requests prevented the database from recovering (ie, capacity was still exceeded).
