  technologies: HAProxy Load Balancer, Internet Information Services (IIS), Puppet
  
  quote: While attempting to make a change enabling streamlined access for our web servers to internal API endpoints [...] a misleading comment in the iptables configuration led us to make a harmful change. 
  
  summary: Defective configuration change to firewall blocked legitimate traffic (Deployment)

  architecture: HAProxy load balancers (with firewall) and IIS web servers (maintained through Git). [3,4]

  root cause: A defective iptable configuration change to the firewall on the load balancers. 3

  failure: The load balancers were not able to complete connections to the web servers because response traffic for those connections was being blocked by the firewall. [4]

  impact: All requests to web servers (through load balancers) failed causing a complete outage. [4]

  how it happened: Defective configuration change pushed to firewall on load balancers, without testing, which prevented load balancers from connecting with web servers since response traffic (from web servers) was blocked. [3,4]
  
  mitigation: Reverted the change and manually ran the configuraion update (using Puppet) rather than wait from normal automatic updates. [6]
