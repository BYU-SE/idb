  technologies:  Google Compute Engine (GCE), Standard Persistent Disks
  quote: Four successive lightning strikes on the local utilities grid that powers our European datacenter caused a brief loss of power to storage systems which host disk capacity for GCE instances in the europe-west1-b zone.
  
structured abstract:

  - name: architecture
    description: Virtual machine instances and attached persistent disks.

  - name: root cause
    description: Local power outage to storage hardware susceptible to power failure.

  - name: failure
    description: Storage systems failed, including some containing data not yet saved to stable storage.

  - name: impact
    description: 5% of persistent disks in region sporadically returned I/O errors to attached virtual machines instances; errors during some disk management operations (eg, snapshot creation); some permanent data loss in small number of cases (0.000001% of persistent disks in region) for data that had not yet been written to stable storage.

  - name: how it happened
    description: Four successive lightning strikes on the local electric grid that powers the datacenter caused a brief loss of power to storage systems. Some of the storage systems were more susceptible to power failure and failed.

  - name: mitigation
    description: Engineers recovered most of the data through snapshots and other operations.
