  technologies: PostgreSQL, Pacemaker
  
  quote: The Pacemaker cluster correctly observed that Postgres was unhealthy on the primary node. It repeatedly attempted to promote a new primary, but each time it couldn't decide where that primary should run. 
  
  summary: Cluster management misconfiguration + coincident disk failure and process crash led to outage (System software or hardware failure) 
  
  architecture: An API layer that connects to a PostgreSQL cluster using a virtual IP address. The cluster has 1 primary node, 1 synchronous replica node and 1 asynchronous replica node. The cluster and virtual IP address is managed by Pacemaker. [12,13]
  
  root cause: A disk array failure on the primary database node combined with a conicident database subprocess crashing on the synchronous replica and some subtle interactions between cluster management configurations. [7,55,72]
  
  failure: Primary database failed and the cluster (managed by Pacemaker) failed to promote a replica to be the new primary, leaving the database unavailable. [7,8]
  
  impact: 1 hour and 50 minute outage of API Dashboard. [6] 
  
  how it happened: A disk array failed on the primary database node and conicidently a database subprocess crashed on the synchronous replica. The cluster management system was then unable to promote one of the replicas to be primary, due to subtle interactions between three configurations. [7,8,55,72]

  mitigation: Put the cluster into maintenance mode, configured the synchronous replica to be a primary, and manually started database. Configured clients of the database with the (non-virtual) IP address of the new primary. [33,34]
