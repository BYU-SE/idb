  fault_type: permanent
  failure_type: fail-silent
  
  quote: These issues caused enough critical impact that Discord's engineering team was forced to fully restart the service, reconnecting millions of clients over a period of 20 minutes.
  
  summary: Automated migration of primary datastore instance + a preexisting failover defect led to cascading outages (Infrastructure change)

  architecture: Multiple highly available clusters with Redis primary and secondary instances. [3]

  root cause: Previously known defect preventing proper failover behavior. [39]

  failure: Memory exhaustion and failing cluster nodes. [40]

  impact: Partial outage and reduced performance. [3]

  how it happened: Automatic migration changed the Redis secondary instance to be the primary instance. Due to a defect in failover code, the cluster nodes did not correctly failover to the new primary instance. This failure cascaded through many dependent systems. [39,40]
  
  mitigation: A full restart of service necessitating reconnecting millions of clients. [46]
