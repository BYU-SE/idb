  quote: These issues caused enough critical impact that Discord's engineering team was forced to fully restart the service, reconnecting millions of clients over a period of 20 minutes.
  summary: Automated migration of primary datastore instance + a preexisting failover defect led to cascading outages (Infrastructure change)

  - name: how it happened
    description: Automatic migration changed the Redis secondary instance to be the primary instance. Due to a defect in failover code, the cluster nodes did not correctly failover to the new primary instance. This failure cascaded through many dependent systems.
