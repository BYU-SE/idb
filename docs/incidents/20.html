      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      During a database upgrade, a defect in the upgrade script led it to believe several active databases were inactive and so it performed the upgrade. Database transactions/replication actions were interrupted and master-replica pairs failed.

      Root cause
    </td>
    <td>
      An upgrade script had a defect in the way that it determined whether a database machine was active (and therefore not safe to upgrade).

      Failure

      Mitigation

      A recovery from backup for each affected database, which took from a few hours to 2 days depending on the database.
