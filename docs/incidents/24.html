    Cloudflare outage on July 17, 2020

<blockquote>
  &ldquo;This configuration contained an error that caused all traffic across our backbone to be sent to Atlanta. This quickly overwhelmed the Atlanta router and caused Cloudflare network locations connected to the backbone to fail.&rdquo;

    </td>
    <td>
      Responders mitigating an (unrelated congestion) issue updated the configuration on a router in one location (Atlanta), with the goal of alleviating congestion. That configuration contained a defect that caused all traffic across the global network to be routed through to that location, overwhelming that router and causing failures for all locations on that network.
