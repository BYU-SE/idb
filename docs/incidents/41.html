      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      New servers were added to the front-end fleet in one region, increasing the number operating system threads used in each of the new and existing front-end server, exceeding the thread limit. Then a wide variety of errors began being reported in the logs and operations began failing.

      Architecture
    </td>
    <td>
      A streaming service (Kinesis) with front-end servers for routing requests and back-end server clusters for processing streams. Routing is based on a sharding strategy, with the shard-map cached by front-end servers. Communication between front-end servers uses one operating system thread per other server.

      Failure

      Impact

      Mitigation
    </td>
    <td>
      Eliminated the additional capacity; made a configuration change to front-end servers to get data from authoritative metadata store rather than from peer servers (to avoid servers being judged as unhealthy during startup); multi-hour restart of front-end.
