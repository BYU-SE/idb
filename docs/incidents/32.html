      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      The datacenter experienced a brief disruption in the systems that supply power to the servers and equipment. 25% of servers and several network devices rebooted, leaving the infrastructure in a partially operational state. Reboots of some machine types failed (due to physical drives not being recognized) and some application processes would not start because Redis clusters were unavailable.

      Power disruption to database; a known firmware issue prevented machines from recognizing their own drives after power-cycle; and some application processes (unnecessarily) depend on Redis for starting up.

      Sever machines would not boot after power-cycle; Redis clusters were unavailable; and application processes failed to (re)start.

      Mitigation
    </td>
    <td>
      Repaired servers that would not boot by removing residual static electricity (aka "flea power"); rebuilt Redis clusters on alternate hardware (ie, restoring data onto standby equipment).
