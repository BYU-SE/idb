    Incident review: API and Dashboard outage on 10 October 2017

<blockquote>
  &ldquo;The Pacemaker cluster correctly observed that Postgres was unhealthy on the primary node. It repeatedly attempted to promote a new primary, but each time it couldn't decide where that primary should run.&rdquo;

      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      A disk array failed on the primary database node and conicidently a database subprocess crashed on the synchronous replica. The cluster management system was then unable to promote one of the replicas to be primary, due to subtle interactions between three configurations.

    <td>
      Architecture
    </td>
    <td>
      An API layer that connects to a PostgreSQL cluster using a virtual IP address. The cluster has 1 primary node, 1 synchronous replica node and 1 asynchronous replica node. The cluster and virtual IP address is managed by Pacemaker.

      Failure
    </td>
    <td>
      Primary database failed and the cluster (managed by Pacemaker) failed to promote a replica to be the new primary, leaving the database unavailable.

      Impact

      1 hour and 50 minute outage of API Dashboard.

      Mitigation
    </td>

      Put the cluster into maintenance mode, configured the synchronous replica to be a primary, and manually started database. Configured clients of the database with the (non-virtual) IP address of the new primary.
