    What We Learned from the Recent Mandrill Outage
  </h1>
  
<blockquote>
  &ldquo;In November of 2018, engineers on our Mandrill team identified the potential to reach wraparound, as the XIDs were climbing to approximately half their total limit during peak load. Our team determined wraparound was not an immediate threat, but we added a ticket to the backlog to set up additional monitoring.&rdquo;

      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      Due to higher than normal traffic to one database (ie, one shard) the autovacuuming process failed or fell behind, and so the database went into safety shutdown mode to prevent transaction id wraparound. Jobs failed and were queued on the application servers causing disk space to run low.
