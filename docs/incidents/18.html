      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      Passwords were rotated for the vSphere API as required and the resource clean up service was not reconfigured with the new password. The clean up service could then no longer clean up virtual machines after use, leading to more than 6000 virtual machines on a cluster that typically has around 200. Due to a defect, the clean up service continued to report the last known number of virtual machines to the metrics system (which delayed notification). Once the initial problem was mitigated, the build service worked to catch up on queued jobs but exceeded capacity of the cluster.

      A resource clean up service did not get updated with the new credentials for the (vSphere) API; a configuration defect approved more virtual machines than could be supprted by the underlying cluster.
