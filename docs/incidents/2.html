      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      A configuration change setting client timeout to 60K secs (rather than the intended 60K ms) was deployed to one of the server's clients. Due to a latent defect, requests from that client were held in memory for 60K seconds. Memory and CPU utilization grew steadily until server was unable to serve requests.

      One client's timeout was set too high (due to confusing seconds with milliseconds); a latent code defect in the server (failure to cleanup per-request context).
