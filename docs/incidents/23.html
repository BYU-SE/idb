      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      Data grew unevenly between two database shards, consuming available memory (66GB) in one shard leading to data reads and writes going to the disk, increasing latency by an order of magnitude for key queries. Requests began backing up and the site crashed.

      Architecture

      A MongoDB database on a two-shard cluster, each replicating to a slave for redundancy. Frequently used data is stored in RAM. Sharding is based on user id.

      Created a third MongoDB shard and moved 5% of the data to the new shard, ran a command (on primary and replica) to compact the database (repairDatabase) to free up enough memory to bring the system online.
