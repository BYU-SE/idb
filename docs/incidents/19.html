      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      Before an upgrade of a Zookeeper system the autoscaler was manually turned off by making a configuration change, since it depends on Zookeeper for server health information. During the upgrade, the package manager reverted the configuration change (since it detected it had been made manually), turing back on the autoscaler. The autoscaler (based on partial Zookeeper data) terminated many healthy servers, including caching servers.
