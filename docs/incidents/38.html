  &ldquo;A bug that caused the user’s phone number and email address to render in the HTML source for people that weren’t the user or an employer attempting to contact the user went unnoticed, because the information wasn’t actually rendered on the page.&rdquo;

      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      A defect was deployed in a private beta feature (developer story CV) and the feature was made public. The defect wasn't noticed because the contact information was not visible on the page. 6 weeks later a user reported that a search for their phone number showed their public CV as the first search result.
