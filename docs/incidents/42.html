  &ldquo;User-visible [services that use the failing service] also saw elevated error rates, although the user impact was greatly reduced by caching and redundancy built into those services.&rdquo;

      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      A data store system had an (unexplained in the report) increase in storage resources used, and so responders made a configuration change which had a side effect of overloading the subsystem used for looking up location of stored data. The increased load led to a cascading failure.

      Engineers stopped the configuration change deployment and manually reduced traffic levels until tasks restarted (as they would otherwise crash on star up due to load).
