<blockquote>
  &ldquo;This change appears to have effects on how bash handles exit codes, in a manner that we have fully investigated yet. This change was not detected by our staging environment tests and revealed insufficient diversity in how our tests reflect the variety of builds ou users are running.&rdquo;

      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      A new version of the service was deployed and builds were being incorrectly marked as failed, so the deployment was rolled back, but the rollback was unsuccessful as the previous version (ie, the version to rollback to) was not marked ("tagged") correctly in the source (Docker Hub).

      Architecture
    </td>
    <td>
      A service that provisions virtual machines (VMs) or containers (for running software builds) and monitors those VMs over their lifetime. The service has multiple backends so the provisioned VM/container can be Docker, Google Compute Engine, vSphere for macOS, etc. The service is autoscaled using many EC2 instances (with solid state drives), with each running a finite number of concurrent jobs.
