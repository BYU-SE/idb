      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      To troubleshoot a bug, the clean up process was turned off and in the meantime the organization began creating more virtual machine images than before, including images that had not yet beeen fully tested. The clean up process was turned back on and retrieved from the database a partial list of valid images (due to a limit of 100 on the query). The clean up process then deleted older, but still in use, images (including the images used most).

      Recovering deleted virtual machine images was not an option so they rolled forward all jobs to the new (not well tested) images. The engineering team spent more than a week fixing issues that arose.
