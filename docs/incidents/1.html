  &ldquo;We woke up at 21:00 UTC almost 4 hours after we went offline to see our phones full of emails, tweets and Slack messages letting us know Buildkite was down. Many expletives were yelled as we all raced out of bed, opened laptops, and started figuring out what was going on.&rdquo;

      How it happened

    <td>
      Downgraded to a lower capacity database instance. At subsequent daily peak, load exceeded database capacity and database connections failed. EC2 instances were removed by the load balancer due to health checks which called the database.
