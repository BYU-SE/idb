      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      Sever weather caused a reduction of utility power at one datacenter (experienced initially as an unusually long voltage sag rather than a complete outage). A set of breakers that would have opened in a complete outage did not open soon enough and the stored power (in the DRUPS) drained into the power grid and the DRUPS system shutdown leaving many visual instances with no power.

      Impact

    <td>
      Once responders determined it was safe to do so, they re-engaged the power line-ups, and then some virtual servers and storage units needed to be manually restored.
