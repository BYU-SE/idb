      How it happened
    </td>
    <td>
      Write requests to a third party dependency (S3) began to experience timeout failures, likely due to a change on the third party side, for a subset of requests. These requests were retried until retry limits were hit. The process writing to the dependency aborted and automatically restarts, redundantly logging each time. The filesystem fills up and the primary service experiences disk write failures and shutsdown.
